# IMMEDIATE SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED

## Critical Security Issue
Your sensitive environment variables were accidentally exposed in documentation. Take these actions immediately:

## 1. Change All Credentials NOW

### MongoDB:
1. Log into MongoDB Atlas
2. Go to Database Access
3. Edit your user and change the password
4. Update the connection string in all deployments

### Gmail App Password:
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Revoke the current app password
3. Generate a new one
4. Update in all deployments

### JWT Secrets:
Generate new secrets immediately:
```bash
# New SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# New REFRESH_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# New CRYPTO_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## 2. Update All Deployed Services

- Update environment variables in Render/Railway
- Update environment variables in Netlify
- Update local .env file
- Restart all services

## 3. Check for Unauthorized Access

- Check MongoDB Atlas logs for unexpected connections
- Review Gmail account activity
- Monitor application logs

## 4. Prevent Future Exposure

### Never put real credentials in:
- Documentation files
- GitHub commits
- Public forums
- Error messages

### Always use:
- Placeholder values in docs
- Environment variable references
- Secure secret management
- .gitignore for .env files

## 5. Git History Cleanup (if needed)

If credentials were committed to Git:
```bash
# Check if exposed in git history
git log -p | grep -i "q4QohuPjf8by4uNz"

# If found, you may need to:
# 1. Use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
# 2. Force push to all branches
# 3. Have all contributors re-clone
```

## Remember:
- This is a critical security issue
- Act immediately
- Change ALL exposed credentials
- Never share real secrets in documentation
